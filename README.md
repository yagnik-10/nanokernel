# NanoKernel

A modern, lightweight kernel implementation focusing on essential operating system concepts. NanoKernel provides a minimal but complete set of kernel features including memory management, process scheduling, and synchronization primitives.

## Features

- **Memory Management**: Custom memory allocator with tracking capabilities
- **Synchronization Primitives**:
  - Reader-Writer Locks
  - Condition Variables
  - Event System
- **Multi-threading Support**: Thread-safe operations and concurrent process execution

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
- CMake 3.10 or higher
- C++17 compatible compiler
- pthread library

### Build Instructions

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### Running the Tests

After building, run the test program:
```bash
./build/nanokernel
```

This will demonstrate:
1. Memory allocation and deallocation
2. Event posting and handling
3. Reader-writer lock synchronization
4. Condition variable synchronization
5. Multi-threaded process execution
